# Password-Genarator
The project is a web-based Password Generator application. The HTML code provides the structure for the application's user interface. Users can click a "Generate" button to create random passwords, which are displayed in an input field. The application also includes a "Copy" button to easily copy the generated password to the clipboard. The functionality of generating and copying passwords is implemented using JavaScript, while the appearance and styling are controlled through an external CSS file. This Password Generator offers a convenient way for users to create strong and secure passwords.
